# Neural Network Text Classification

This repository demonstrates the use of various text classification algorithms. It includes implementations for CNN, FNN, RCNN, and fastText models to classify text data.

## Features:
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning model for text classification.
- **FNN (Feedforward Neural Network)**: Another approach for text classification using a multi-layer neural network.
- **RCNN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network)**: Combines CNN and RNN for better text feature extraction.
- **fastText**: A library for fast text classification based on word embeddings.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided).

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarawanHassaan/text-classification.git
   ```
2. Run the necessary model script (e.g., CNN.py, FNN.py, etc.) depending on your choice of algorithm:
   ```bash
   python CNN.py
   ```
